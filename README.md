# Hands-on-Deep-Learning-Python
Master Deep Learning Algorithms with Extensive Math by Implementing them using TensorFlow
Deep learning is one of the most popular domains in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, which allows you to develop multi-layered models of varying complexities.First, you will get a good understanding of the fundamentals of neural networks and several variants of gradient descent algorithms. Later, you will explore RNN, Bidirectional RNN, LSTM, GRU, seq2seq, CNN, capsule nets and more. Then, you will master GAN and various types of GANs and several different autoencoders.
